"For any gas whose equation of state is given exactly by py 5 RT, the specific internal  energy depends on temperature only. This conclusion is demonstrated formally in  Sec. 11.4. It is also supported by experimental observations, beginning with the work specific volume) depends primarily on temperature. Further motivation from the  microscopic viewpoint is provided shortly. The specific enthalpy of a gas described by py 5 RT also depends on temperature only, as can be shown by combining the definition of enthalpy, h 5 u 1 py, with u 5 u(T) and the ideal gas equation of state to obtain h 5 u(T) 1 RT. Taken together, these specifications constitute the ideal gas model, summarized as follows

pv = RT (3.32)
u = u(T) (3.36)
h = h(t) = u(T)+ RT (3.37)

The specific internal energy and enthalpy of gases generally depend on two independent properties, not just temperature as presumed by the ideal gas model. Moreover, the ideal gas equation of state does not provide an acceptable approximation at all states. Accordingly, whether the ideal gas model is used depends on the error acceptable in a given calculation. Still, gases often do approach ideal gas behavior, and a particularly simplified description is obtained with the ideal gas model."
